# Redefine Gentrification Project-Part 2

### In this project, our team analyzed sets of data consisting of housing sales in the top 5 most gentrified cities across the United States. Using the data we predicted the cost to revamp a given urban neighborhood across the U.S. 

### Our mission is to provide each community with the financial cost of redeveloping from within and preventing gentrification by big businesses.

## Summary of Project-Part 1

### [What is Gentrification?](https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFKJ45J-LMg)

Gentrification is a process in which a poor area (as of a city) experiences an influx of middle-class or wealthy people who renovate and rebuild homes and businesses and which often results in an increase in property values and the displacement of earlier, usually poorer residents

### Criteria Used to Evaluate Gentrification

Five factors that are examined for an area to be susceptible to gentrification:
1. Which communities are most at risk from job displacement in the hospitality, retail, personal care, and service sectors.
2. Which communities are at risk due to a disproportionate high percentage of residents not enrolled in Unemployment Insurance benefits
3. Which communities have high numbers of renter households that are experiencing extreme financial hardships
4. Which communities are most burdened by shelter-in-place mandates
5. Which communities are likely to be unrepresented in the census due to low response rates

### Types of Gentrification

In 2018, Los Angeles exhibited the highest rates of gentrification, with 10% of areas classified as At Risk of Gentrification, Early/Ongoing Gentrification, or Advanced Gentrification. In addition, 5% of areas were not gentrifying but experienced Ongoing Displacement of Low-Income Households. Nearly half of all Atlanta neighborhoods experienced a rapid increase in housing costs between 2000 and 2017. 22% of lower-income neighborhoods in Atlanta were at risk of gentrification in 2017, and 7% were undergoing displacement of low-income households without gentrification. Almost 8% of low-income households in the metro region are living in moderate to high income neighborhoods that are experiencing advanced stages or super gentrification.

### Real Estate Data Elements

With this data, communities will possess the same data that real estate investment companies use to gentrify cities. This gives a financial estimate as to what it would cost to redevelop a community.

### A World Without Gentrification!

### So how would we do this?
We would create a DAO (decentralized Autonomous Organization) with a token sale based on the valuation data gained. The community will use this data to pick opportunity zones. The voting system that will be set up to these communities to hold a larger voting power than those just financially invested. We hope to build a future where the voting system can cover items such as which opportunity zones to invest in. Whether that being swim clubs over parks or basketball courts over tennis courts. Create a community that will truly reflect the people that live there.
